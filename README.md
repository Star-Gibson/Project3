## Description
The Juicy Smoothie application gives users a secure portal to maintain a smoothie recipe book and view other user's recipes. Your health is important and we want to empower you with all the resources you need to create a healthy diet based on your health needs.

Once logged in, users can create a profile with a photo, create new personal recipes, and search for recipes from other users to get new ideas! If another user has a recipe that you like, but you want to put your own spin on it, you can make a new recipe based off of another one and save the new one.
  
## Usage
As a user:
I want to be able to login to a secure portal that will allow me to maintain a virtual smoothie recipe book based on my health needs.

### Dashboard Page:    
The Dashboard is the homepage where the user can view a recipe of the week and view their own recipes.

### Search Recipe Page:  
The Search page allows the user to search across saved recipes to find one that meets their needs. From here, the user can click to see more details about the recipe in a modal. The user can also rate other user's recipes and the average rating will be displayed with the recipe information.

### New Recipe Page: 
The New Recipe page is where the user can add new recipes to their recipe list. Once created, the recipe can be deleted if the user decides it's not one they want to share anymore.
